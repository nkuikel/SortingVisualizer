## Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This is an interactive algorithm visualizer created by using PyGame, where you can see how the three sorting algorithms sort numbers. You can either sort random numbers or give your custom number list to sort. Also, you can adjust the sorting speed via the slider in real time. This project seemed a little common so I added custom number sorting option and speed adjusting function to make it unique.
